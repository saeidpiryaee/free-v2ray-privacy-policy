Privacy Policy for V2Ray Config
Last Updated: November 10, 2023

Pinky Promise ("we," "our," "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app, V2Ray Config.

1. Information We Collect
We use third-party services like Appodeal for ads and Firebase Analytics for analytics, which may collect the following information:

Device information (e.g., device ID, IP address, operating system).
Usage data (e.g., app opens, session duration, in-app actions).
Ad interaction data (e.g., clicks, impressions).
Approximate location data (if enabled).
Our app uses the Appodeal SDK to display ads, including rewarded video and banner ads. For more details on how Appodeal handles your data, please refer to Appodeal's Privacy Policy.

2. How We Use Your Information
The data collected by Appodeal is used to display personalized ads and enhance your ad experience.
The data collected by Firebase Analytics is used to analyze app usage and improve our services.
3. Sharing Your Information
We share your information with third-party services like Appodeal and Firebase Analytics to deliver ads and analyze app usage. These third parties have their own privacy policies, which we recommend you review:

Appodeal: https://www.appodeal.com/privacy-policy
Google (for Firebase Analytics): https://policies.google.com/privacy
Note: While the app previously used Google AdMob, the current version primarily integrates Appodeal, which may mediate ads from multiple networks, including AdMob. We’ve retained Firebase Analytics based on its mention in your prior policy, but if it’s no longer used, you may remove references to it.

4. Security
We take reasonable steps to protect your information, but no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

5. Your Choices
You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device settings (e.g., under "Google Settings" or "Privacy" on Android) or using the ad settings provided by the ad networks.

6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please review it periodically for any changes.
